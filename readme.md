This is my second attempt of creating the popular game rock paper & scissors. When I first completed this project i didn't feel confident in that i understood the code, now I've decided to revisit it with a much better understanding of javascript.

I also wasn't able to use git properly, so I want to use this as an opportunity to practise using git.

This time, I will be coding it with less assistance and trying to do it myself. I will note any new things that I have learnt during this process.


I keep making small errors which I think is because I try to rush it rather than taking my time and understanding fully what I'm coding. 

I need to break it down into very simple terms in what's needed and taking it step by step. An improvement would be to first put it in pseudocode and then taking it from the top to bottom.

After completing it, I found it much easier than when I first done it, I felt like I understood what I was doing and I was able to comment each line more confidently.
