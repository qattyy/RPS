This is my second attempt of creating the popular game rock paper & scissors. When I first completed this project i didn't feel confident in that i understood the code, now I've decided to revisit it with a much better understanding of javascript.

I also wasn't able to use git properly, so I want to use this as an opportunity to practise using git.

This time, I will be coding it with less assistance and trying to do it myself. I will note any new things that I have learnt during this process.
