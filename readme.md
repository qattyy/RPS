This is my second attempt of creating the popular game rock paper & scissors. When I first completed this project i didn't feel confident in that i understood the code, now I've decided to revisit it with a much better understanding of javascript.

I also wasn't able to use git properly, so I want to use this as an opportunity to practise using git.

This time, I will be coding it with less assistance and trying to do it myself. I will note any new things that I have learnt during this process.


I keep making small errors which I think is because I try to rush it rather than taking my time and understanding fully what I'm coding. 

I need to break it down into very simple terms in what's needed and taking it step by step. An improvement would be to first put it in pseudocode and then taking it from the top to bottom.

After completing it, I found it much easier than when I first done it, I felt like I understood what I was doing and I was able to comment each line more confidently. 



-- Added UI

After completing a basic RPS that ran through the console log, the next challenge was to create it and displaying it on the DOM. I decided to use emojis to represent the rock,paper, scissors and assigned them to buttons. 

I found this more challenging, and saw myself using google more often than before. I particularly struggled at the part of making the buttons represent each rock,paper and scissors. I learnt how to use data- and was able to implement this in the code. 

I also feel more comfortable using forEach, and understanding how not everything necessarily needs to be declared as an array first to use forEach.  I also shortened by code that was responsible for the functionality of RPS, and I saw myself trying to clean my code that I previously had.

I created another branch that was separate from the main, and managed to push it to the main and replace what I had using git. This all worked out all well and is updated on my github repo. I feel like as I use git more and more, I feel like it becomes more second nature when using it. 

Overall, this project was very beneficial and I came out practising and learning more HTML,CSS,JS and Git.
